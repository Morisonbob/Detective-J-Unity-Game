<b>#Talking Design#</b>

I wanted to create a <b>narrative driven game with branching dialogue choices</b> and some puzzles, with an Ace Attorney inspiration, so I tought that a kinda noir detective setting was a good place to start doing what I wanted to do.

<b>Dialogue System</b>

The dialogue system is the star of the scripts, it controlls what texts can be shown, in what order, depending of what you done, the order in wich you interact with the objects change the kind of text you will get from this object, you can miss a lot of lines of dialogue or even lose acess to some puzzles depending on what you did, because the system tha control the dialogues also controlls when to open puzzles, what hint to give you and a lot of the game world.

I'm really proud of this dialogue system, is versatile enough to do a range of stuff and can be edited using a single JSON file if necessary, so no programming knowledge is needed when working on dialogues on this game.

<b>Puzzles</b>

I wanted to put at least 3 different types of puzzles in the game, so the gameplay don't get hyper focused on the dialogues 100% of the time and to combine with the "vibe" of the game, to make the player feel like he has some investigation to do.

Two puzzles are number guessing" type of puzzles that can be used in a variety of forms, and one is a jigsaw puzzle. The tree of them are made in a way to make it be "generic" so a designer could change a lot about the puzzles without a need to touch the code.

This was one of the most fun and challenging games that I've made and is not yet finished, I don't know how long it will take me to put the game in a "finished" state
