<b>#Talking Design#</b>

I wanted to create a <b> narrative-driven game with branching dialogue choices</b> and some puzzles, with an Ace Attorney inspiration, so I thought that a kinda noir detective setting was a good place to start doing what I wanted to do.

<b>Dialogue System</b>

The dialogue system is the star of the scripts, it controls what texts can be shown, in what order, and depending on what you did, the order in which you interact with the objects changes the kind of text you will get from this object, you can miss a lot of lines of dialogue or even lose access to some puzzles depending on what you did, because the system that controls the dialogues also controls when to open puzzles, what hints to give you and a lot of the game world logic.

I'm really proud of this dialogue system, is versatile enough to do a range of stuff and can be edited using a single JSON file if necessary, so no programming knowledge is needed when working on dialogues on this game.

<b>Puzzles</b>

I wanted to put at least 3 different types of puzzles in the game, so the gameplay doesn't get hyper-focused on the dialogues 100% of the time and to combine with the "vibe" of the game, to make the player feel like he has some investigation to do.

Two puzzles are number guessing" type of puzzles that can be used in a variety of forms, and one is a jigsaw puzzle. The three of them are made in a way to make it "generic" so a designer could change a lot about the puzzles without a need to touch the code.

<b><i>Some examples of the puzzles</i></b>

This was one of the most fun and challenging games that I've made and is not yet finished, I don't know how long it will take me to put the game in a "finished" state,  but I'll make it available for download as soon as the game is complete.

Thank you for seeing my stuff.
